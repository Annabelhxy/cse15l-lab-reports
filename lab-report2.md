* Which methods in your code are called?
handleRequest

* What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?

* How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.


## Part 2
Debug for ArrayMethods

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
```
@Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input2 = {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3, 2, 1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input2));
  }
```

An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
```
@Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)


The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
